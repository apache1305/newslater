Build a newsletter subscriptions platform (Language Agnostic)

Problem statement:
You have come up with an idea to build a newsletter subscription platform. Users can subscribe to monthly newsletters on your platform. (Rest API)

We have 3 entities:

2. Newsletter: id, category_id, title, user_id, price
3. Category: id, name

- Register user API:

Allow users to register on the platform. They should be able to register on the platform using their name and email.

Sample request: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@wonderfulemail.com" }
Sample response: { "user_id": 1 }

Any user should be able to query the newsletters on this platform using categories.

Sample request: { "categories" : [ "science", "technology"] }
Sample response: 
{"newsletters":[{"science":[{"newsletter_id":1,"title":"Latest in tech by John Doe"},{"newsletter_id":2,"title":"Old in science by John Doe"}]},{"technology":[{"newsletter_id":1,"title":"Latest in tech by John Doe"}]}]}
{
  "newsletters": [
    {
      "science": [
        {
          "newsletter_id": 1,
          "title": "Latest in tech by John Doe"
        },
        {
